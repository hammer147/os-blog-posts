Getting a column in a table or range is a common task.  

## Table

Getting a column in a table is straightforward.  
ExcelScript has build in functions for this on the [Table interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/office-scripts/excelscript/excelscript.table?view=office-scripts).

- getColumn()
- getColumnByName()
- getColumnById()

## Range

We could consider to convert the range to a table and use the above functions.  
Something like this: workbook.addTable(myRange, true)

In case we don't want to convert the range to a table, we can use myRange.getColumn(colIdx).
The problem is that we have to pass the column index, which is not ideal.  
We can use the following function to get the column index from the column name.

```ts
/**
 * Finds a title in a row and returns the column index (0-based) of the first match (or -1 if no match)
 * @param title The title you are searching
 * @param sh The worksheet to search in
 * @param rowIdx Optional. The index of the row (in usedRange) to search in, 0-based. Default is 0.
 */
function getColIdxByTitle(title: string, sh: ExcelScript.Worksheet, rowIdx: number = 0): number {
  const rngTitles = sh.getUsedRange().getRow(rowIdx)
  const colIdx = rngTitles
    .find(title, {
      completeMatch: true /* No match if the cell text only contains the text to find as part of another string. */,
      matchCase: false,
      searchDirection:
        ExcelScript.SearchDirection.forward /* Start at the beginning of the range and go to later columns and rows. */,
    })
    ?.getColumnIndex()
  return colIdx ?? -1
}
```

## Worksheet column indexes

In some cases it can be useful to get the column index of a column in the worksheet.  
The index of column A is 0, B is 1, etc.  
Here is a function for this:
  
  ```ts
  /** Returns the 0-based index of a column */
function getColIdx(col: string) {
  return col.split('').reduce((prev, next) => prev * 26 + parseInt(next, 36) - 9, 0) - 1
}

console.log(getColIdx('a')) // 0
console.log(getColIdx('z')) // 25
console.log(getColIdx('AC')) // 28
  ```
