Adding data to a worksheet is very common.
Here is an example how to do this and some gotchas to look out for.

## Gotcha 1: there might be no data to write

To write data to a worksheet, we need a 2D array.  
This array is usually dynamically created and might be empty.  
To avoid an error, it is a good idea to check that there actually _is_ data to write.

```ts
// if there is no data, do nothing
if (!data.length) return
```

## Gotcha 2: the sheet we write to might be empty

To determine the first free row, we simply count the rows in the used range.  
The result will be the index of the first free row, because the index is 0-based.  
We need to be careful, because when our sheet is empty, sh.getUsedRange() would return undefined.  
Calling .getRowCount() on undefined would throw an error.
We can avoid this by using optional chaining (.?) and nullish coalescing (??). The index of the first free row is 0 on an empty sheet.

```ts
// find idx of first free row
// note that getUsedRange returns undefined when sheet is empty and idx is 0-based
const firstFreeRowIdx = sh.getUsedRange()?.getRowCount() ?? 0
```

## A complete example

```ts
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
  const sh = workbook.getFirstWorksheet()

  const data: (string | number)[][] = [
    ['Alice', 12],
    ['Bob', 34],
    ['Carol', 56]
  ]

  // if there is no data, do nothing
  if (!data.length) return

  // find idx of first free row
  // note that getUsedRange returns undefined when sheet is empty and idx is 0-based
  const firstFreeRowIdx = sh.getUsedRange()?.getRowCount() ?? 0

  const range = sh.getRangeByIndexes(firstFreeRowIdx, 0, data.length, data[0].length)

  range.setValues(data)
}
```
