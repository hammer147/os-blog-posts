Data is often stored in csv files.  
Via Power Automate, it is very easy to obtain the file content of such files and pass the csv as a string to an Office script.  
The script below comes from the Microsoft documentation and writes each row separately to a sheet.  
Notice that the delimiter in the example below is a semicolon, if the csv has another delimiter, it needs to be changed in 3 different lines.  
When the csv contains dates, make sure the columns in Excel are formatted as **Text**, otherwise the dates will be converted to numbers (often in the wrong way!).  
The post about dates has a script that can be used to convert the string dates to the correct Excel date numbers.  

```ts
/**
 * Convert incoming CSV data into a range and add it to the workbook.
 * @tutorial https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/scripts/resources/samples/convert-csv
 */
function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook, csv: string) {
  let sheet = workbook.getWorksheet('Sheet1')

  // Remove any Windows \r characters.
  csv = csv.replace(/\r/g, '')

  // Split each line into a row.
  let rows = csv.split('\n')

  /*
   * For each row, match the comma-separated sections.
   * For more information on how to use regular expressions to parse CSV files,
   * see this Stack Overflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/a/48806378/9227753
   */

  // CHANGE THE DELIMITER TWICE IN THE NEXT LINE (replace ;)
  const csvMatchRegex = /(?:;|\n|^)("(?:(?:"")*[^"]*)*"|[^";\n]*|(?:\n|$))/g

  rows.forEach((value, index) => {
    if (value.length > 0) {
      let row = value.match(csvMatchRegex)

      // Check for blanks at the start of the row.
      // CHANGE THE DELIMITER IN THE NEXT LINE (replace ;)
      if (row[0].charAt(0) === ';') {
        row.unshift('')
      }

      // Remove the preceding comma.
      row.forEach((cell, index) => {
        // CHANGE THE DELIMITER IN THE NEXT LINE (replace ;)
        row[index] = cell.indexOf(';') === 0 ? cell.substr(1) : cell
      })

      // Create a 2D array with one row.
      let data: string[][] = []

      data.push(row)

      // Put the data in the worksheet.
      let range = sheet.getRangeByIndexes(index, 0, 1, data[0].length)
      range.setValues(data)
    }
  })

  // Add any formatting or table creation that you want.
}
```
